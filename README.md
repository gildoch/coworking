## About <a name = "about"></a>

A coworking space is a shared office environment for freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs. It provides a collaborative and productive environment for individuals to work in, and has become increasingly popular in recent years. In this README, I will be showing a sample website that showcases different coworking spaces built using HTML and CSS.

## Requirements <a name = "requirements"></a>

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text
- Browser to view the website

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started, you will need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. You will also need a text editor such as Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   `git clone https://github.com/gildoch/coworking-space.git`
2. Open the index.html file in your text editor.
3. Open the style.css file in your text editor.
4. Start making changes to the HTML and CSS files.

## HTML Structure <a name = "html_structures"></a>

The HTML structure for the coworking space website is quite simple. We have a header that contains the logo and navigation menu. We also have a main section that displays the different coworking spaces, and a footer that contains copyright information and additional links.

## CSS Styles <a name = "css_styles"></a>

The CSS stylesheet will be used to style the HTML structure. Some of the styles to be defined include:

1. **Fonts**: Choose a font that is professional and easy to read.
2. **Colors**: Choose a color scheme that is consistent and reflects the brand identity of the coworking space.
3. **Layout**: Define the layout for different sections, such as the header, footer and so on.
4. **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the website is optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

## Final Thoughts <a name = "final_thoughts"></a>

With this simple project I learnt some CSS concepts:

- using margin: auto on flex children
- position: absolute, relative & fixed
- align-sef on flex-box childre

With these basic HTML and CSS building blocks, you can create a simple and effective website for a coworking space. Remember to test your website on different browsers and devices to ensure that it looks and functions as expected.
